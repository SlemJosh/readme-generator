## README Generator

## Description
This project was about coding and creating a program that would help us to create simple and fast readme files.  I went through the process of learning Node and learning about some
npm packages.   The basics were just to ask the right questions to the user, and to have the answers displayed in a format that the user can use (myself included) for future readme files.
As I was creating it, I noticed a few important things.  For one, when we are creating a file that is as important as a README, we want to make sure that it doesn't override our current one, 
so having a seperate location for that to be written to is important. I also went through several attempts at asking questions about pathing for adding image files, and that proved to be
problematic, and in the long run probably not worth it.  The whole idea of this is to simpify the process.  

## Installation
To use you will need node, and the npm's inquierer, and fs.  These can be installed with an npm i.

## Usage
