## README Generator

## Description
This project was about coding and creating a program that would help us to create simple and fast README files. I went through the process of learning Node and exploring some npm packages. The basics were simply to ask the right questions to the user and to display the answers in a format that the user can use (myself included) for future README files. As I was creating it, I noticed a few important things. For one, when we are creating a file as important as a README, we want to make sure that it doesn't override our current one, so having a separate location for that to be written to is important. I also went through several attempts at asking questions about paths for adding image files, and that proved to be problematic and, in the long run, probably not worth it. The whole idea of this is to simplify the process.

## Installation
To use it, you will need Node.js and the npm packages Inquirer and fs. You can install them by opening up your terminal and typing "npm i".

## Usage

To use it for yourself, simply navigate your terminal to the same directory as the index.js file and type "node index.js".


## Credits
The inquirer npm was very helpful in creating this project.
